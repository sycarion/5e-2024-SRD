# Latest 5e SRD Reformatted

### What is the purpose of this site?

This is an adaptation of the Latest 5E SRD Reformatted in Markdown (.MD) for easy export to other publishing formats. Please report any issues or discrepancies within the material itself; see Discussions & Issues below.

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for publishing content under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) (“CC-BY-4.0”). The Latest SRD is version 5.2.1. The published SRD is available in PDF form here: [SRD on D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd?srsltid=AfmBOoodnH0n5XjEXsWeKHi31QA3aZqL7ifMME3P5A2LwJDWsT3XUGNw).

[Old Man Umby](https://github.com/OldManUmby/DND.SRD.Wiki/) Did a TON of work to re-master the 5.1 SRD line-by-line into Markdown format. Like his project that I forked here, the purpose of this site if for the markdown files to be utilized in your own 5E projects. I will update this site as changes are introduced, but it may take me a bit to do it.

 <summary>Future Goals</summary>

 1. After the initial conversion of the latest SRD, I will provide my own homebrew under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) (“CC-BY-4.0”). I'm not here to sell 5e content, I just enjoy playing games.
 2. I hope to include other SRDs as well.

 <summary>What Kind of Content will you share?</summary>

 1. Locations, like Columbris, a non-Potter magic school.
 2. Magic Systems, like Salt Magic.
 3. Creatures, like Mumblers, cursed abdead spellcasters.
 4. Species, Backgrounds, and Tools, oh my!
 5. Cosmologies - universes where the canon D&D lore is very different are different.
 6. NPCS for encounters on the fly.
 7. Everything else I couldn't think of to list here.
